# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed DataCamp Intro to Python for Data Scientist: Functions, Methods, Packages, NumPy 2D array 

**Thoughts:** This is getting pretty interesting. Still feel a bit challenged in terms of grasping the concept

### Day 2: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Coursera's Programming for Everyone (Getting started with PYthon) by University of Michigan

**Thoughts:** Datacamp only offered the introductory lesson free. Transitioned over to Coursera since auditing is allowed. The beginning is more theory-based.
